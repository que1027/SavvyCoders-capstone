## Submitting _Week 1_ Homework, this is due to your TA by End of Day (EOD) Sunday before Week 4

1. **If you have not done so, create an account for yourself on** [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com/)

    > **Note:** _Your username on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) should be professional!_

2. **Create a capstone repo on GitHub using the [Savvy Starter Repo Template](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter) and clone it down to your local environment.**

    **Important**: Remember to use the [**Savvy Starter Repo Template**](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter) for this!

    **Steps to do this can be found here: [**Using the Savvy Starter Template to create a capstone repo**](https://github.com/savvy-coders/sc-curriculum/blob/master/Section02/2.1.1-GitandGitHub.md#git-activity-2-everyone)**

3. Create a `development` branch.

    > You do this by first navigating to your locally cloned capstone repository directory from in your Terminal. Once you navigate into your `capstone` directory, If you haven't done so already, you run the command `git checkout -b development` to make a new development branch. You should now see in your Terminal that you are your `development` branch.

4. Open **VSCode** and create a `docs` folder inside of your **Cloned Capstone Repository**.

5. Inside your `docs` folder, create a `project-planning.md` file.

    > **_Note: To do this Right Click on your `docs` Folder then click add file. Then name that file_** `project-planning.md`


- Add all your project documentation into this markdown(md) file. Here you will add your Links, images, and/or PDF files. You do this by accessing your file explorer on your pc going to where you save the photos then dragging and dropping your photos/files into your **`docs`** Folder.

    > **Note:** It could be useful to create a separate **`pictures`** or **`img`** folder inside of your `docs` folder to collect and store images for your Homework and Capstone.
