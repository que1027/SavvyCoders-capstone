        <p>
Hi my name is Quinton Taylor I have had a bit of experience coding through my pursue of an associate degree. I currently work a helpdesk technician role which has further solidified my goal and I’m currently looking to gain a software engineering position that employs a lot of teamwork.
I am a cyber security major and I’m currently working as a helpdesk technician at SLPL. I enjoy gaming and watching movies, and I have a lot of informal coding experience. With that being said I am always looking to learn new things and I don’t think ill ever stop learning new things.
I’ve decided to go through savvy coders because I am interested in obtaining a software engineering role.
I began coding just because it seemed cool, but eventually I really got into it because of the challenge that it gives me.
